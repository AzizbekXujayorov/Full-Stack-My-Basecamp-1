## MyBasecamp1
What is basecamp?
It's a web-based project management tool launched in 2004. Its primary features are to-do lists, milestone management, forum-like messaging, file sharing, and time tracking - [basecamp](https://basecamp.com/)

You will have a to create a website which mimique features from the original tools. It means having a database, a backend and a frontend.
This project is splitted in 3 parts.

We want our users to create their accounts, to connect and create projects!

As developer you need to think about the User Experience and it needs to be great.

Here is the technical specifications:

First step of MyBaseCamp should have the following features:

### Features:

1. User Registration - User #new - User #show - User #create - User #destroy
In summary, you should be able to create a new user, delete a user, and as a new user, create an account yourself.

2. Session - User #sign_in - User #sign_out
Users should be able to log in and log out.

3. Role Permission - User setAdmin - User removeAdmin
This means you will have two types of permissions, someone who is a user, and someone who is a user and an admin. We want the ability to also remove the admin permission from a user.

4. Project - Project #new - Project #show - Project #edit - Project #destroy
Similar to the real Basecamp, users should be able to create, edit, and destroy a project.
