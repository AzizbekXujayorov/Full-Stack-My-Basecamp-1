# Welcome to My Basecamp 1
***

## Task
Create MyBaseCamp, a web-based project management tool inspired by Basecamp, with features for user registration, session management, role permissions, and project management.

## Description
MyBaseCamp is a full-stack web application developed using ReactJS for the frontend and Node.js/Express.js for the backend. MongoDB is utilized as the database to store user and project data.

## Installation
To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone <repository_url>
```


2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd <project_directory>

```


3. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
```
cd frontend
```
```
npm install
```
```
cd ../backend
```
```
npm install
```

4. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a .env file in the backend directory.
   - Add necessary environment variables like PORT, MONGODB_URI, JWT_SECRET, etc.

5. Start the backend server:
```
npm start
```


7. Access the application in your web browser using the provided URL (typically http://localhost:3000).

## Usage
Once the application is running, users can:
- Register a new account.
- Log in to their account.
- Create, edit, and delete projects.
- Assign admin roles to users.
- Revoke admin permissions.
- Log out securely.
